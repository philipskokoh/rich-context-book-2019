\section{Additional Dataset Linking (Phase 1)}

To predict the citations we use all mentions from one publication and look how many words from a data set title could be matched. As an additional feature we do the same with extracted years of the sentences where the mentions are found. We combine the results with a weighted scheme. The title match takes 85\% of the final score, and the year occurence 15%.
