<p>Data are valuable but finding the right data is often difficult. This
chapter reviews current approaches and issues for metadata about numeric
data and data sets that may facilitate the identification of relevant
data. In addition, the chapter reviews how metadata support
repositories, portals, and services. There are emerging metadata
standards but they are applied unevenly so that there is no
comprehensive approach. There has been greater emphasis on structural
issues than on semantic descriptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1>INTRODUCTION<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Evidence-based policy needs relevant data (Commission on Evidence-Based
Policy, 2018; Lane, 2016). Such data is valuable, but often difficult to
find and/or replicate. The FAIR Open Access guidelines suggest that,
ideally, data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and
Reusable.[^1] Therefore, data curation and stewardship is needed.</p>
<p>While data may include text, image, or video, here we focus on numeric
observations recorded and maintained in machine-readable form. There are
many data sets of such observations available online; the DataCite<a class="reference external" href="https://datacite.org/">^2</a>
repository alone contains over five million. There are many different
types of data sets. Data sets differ in their structure, their source,
and their use. In some cases, they are single vectors of data; in other
cases, they comprise all the data associated with one study or across a
group of related data sets. Following the approach of W3C-DCAT (World
Wide Web Consortium-Data Catalog Vocabulary)<a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">^3</a>, a data set may be a
collection of related observations which is developed and managed by a
single entity such as a statistical agency. When stored as a unit
online, the data set is a digital object.</p>
<p>Metadata consists of short descriptors which refer to a digital object.
Metadata can support users in finding data sets, and enable users to
know what is in them. However, there is tremendous variability in the
types of metadata and how they are applied. One categorization of
metadata identifies structural (or technical), administrative, and
descriptive metadata. Structural metadata includes the organization of
the files. Administrative metadata describes the permissions, rights,
and usage. Descriptive metadata covers the contents.</p>
<p>This chapter surveys the state of the art of metadata for numeric data
sets, focusing on metadata for administrative and social science
records. Administrative records describe details about the state of the
world as collected by organizations or agencies. They include
governmental records, hospital records, educational records, and
business records. By comparison, social science data generally is
collected for the purpose of developing or applying theory.</p>
<p>Section 2 describes data, metadata, and digital objects. Section 3
discusses semantics. Section 4 considers repositories. Section 5
describes services. Section 6 describes the techniques for documenting
the internal structure of data sets. Section 7 discusses
cyberinfrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-metadata-and-digital-data-objects">
<h1>DATA, METADATA, AND DIGITAL DATA OBJECTS<a class="headerlink" href="#data-metadata-and-digital-data-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A metadata element describes some attribute of a digital object. The
simplest metadata identifies the digital object.[^4] Individual metadata
elements are generally part of a set which describes attributes of a
data set. Such a set of metadata elements can be structured as a
catalog, schema, or frame, and restrictions can be placed on the values
allowed for the individual elements. A fragment of an example of the
Schema.org[^5] dataset schema is shown in Figure 1. Note the distinct
metadata elements in that fragment.</p>
<p>Figure 1: Fragment of schema.org dataset schema[^6].</p>
<p>The W3C DCAT<a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">^7</a> is a schema standard for data sets that is used by many
repositories such as data.gov. Other structured frameworks for data sets
include the DataCite<a class="reference external" href="https://schema.datacite.org/">^8</a> metadata schema and the Inter-university
Consortium for Political and Social Research Data Documentation
Initiative (ICPSR DDI) discussed below (Section 4.1). The catalog
specifications provide a flexible framework. For instance, DCAT allows
the inclusion of metadata elements drawn from domain schema and
ontologies. Some of these domain schemas are widely used resources which
DCAT refers to as assets. For instance, spatial relationships are often
modeled by the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) standard.<a class="reference external" href="https://www.fgdc.gov/">^9</a></p>
<p>Many of the implementations for indexing collections of metadata schemas
use relational databases. Thus, they use SQL and support tools such as
data dictionaries. Moreover, they are often characterized by Unified
Modeling Language (UML) Class Diagrams which are common for data
modeling.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="semantic-descriptions">
<h1>SEMANTIC DESCRIPTIONS<a class="headerlink" href="#semantic-descriptions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Semantic data models have become widely explored. In particular, the
Semantic Web utilizes nodes which are implemented with XML. RDF
(Resource Description Framework) extends XML by requiring triples which
assert a relationship (property) between two identifiers:
“identifier”-“property”-“identifier”. By connecting triples, RDF can
define a graph network of the relationships among a set of controlled
vocabulary terms; this is the essence of linked data.</p>
<p>RDFS (RDF Schema) extends RDF by supporting class/subclass
relationships. The classes allowed for identifiers in RDFS triples are
controlled by domain and range parameters. Traditional thesauri have a
simple hierarchical structure, the Simple Knowledge Organization System
(SKOS) is an RDFS standard for a machine-processable representation of
thesauri. Many administrative and social-science-related thesauri such
as EDGAR, and those of the World Bank, and the OECD have now been
implemented with SKOS. In addition, a knowledge graph is a model of a
domain, sometimes including instances, which may be implemented in SKOS.
For example, DBpedia<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/">^10</a> is a knowledge graph based on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Some frameworks for structural descriptions of data sets include aspects
of ontologies. For example, less formal ontologies simply provide
definitions and employ RDFS. Similarly, Schema.org schemas can be used
with micro-formats which match schema elements with passages in an
online text. Schema.org has a classification of topics and may
incorporate other systems such as FOAF (Friend of a Friend) which
includes attributes associated with people. Formal ontologies use OWL
(Web Ontology Language) to add features to RDFS. These features lend
themselves to logical inference provided that the entities and
relationships are rigorously defined.</p>
<p>Upper ontologies provide top-down structures for the types of entities
allowed in derivative domain and application ontologies. One of the best
known upper ontologies is the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) (Arp, Smith, &amp;
Spear, 2015), which is a realist, Aristotelian approach. At the
top-level, BFO distinguishes between Continuants (endurants) and
Occurrents (perdurants) and also between Universals and Particulars
(instances). Many biological ontologies have been developed based on BFO
and are collected in the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry.</p>
<p>There are fewer rich ontologies dealing with social science content than
there are for natural science. One challenge is “social ontology”, that
is, developing definitions for social terms. It is difficult to define
exactly what is a family, a crime, or money. In most cases, an
operational definition or an approximate definition may suffice where
structured documentation of the definitions are unavailable. Moreover,
while social terms are especially difficult to define for vernacular
speech, it seems possible to make clear, though perhaps cumbersome,
definitions for scholarly applications.</p>

<div class="section" id="data-repositories">
<h1>DATA REPOSITORIES<a class="headerlink" href="#data-repositories" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A data repository holds data sets and related digital objects. It
provides access to the data sets and supports search. Metadata is
integral to these services at several levels. In addition to item-level
metadata for the data sets, there can also be study-level metadata or
collection-level metadata.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-inter-university-consortium-for-political-and-social-research-icpsr">
<h2>The Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)<a class="headerlink" href="#the-inter-university-consortium-for-political-and-social-research-icpsr" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ICPSR<a class="reference external" href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/">^11</a> is a major repository of public-use social science and
administrative data sets derived from questionnaires and surveys. The
ICPSR DDI[^12] (e.g., Vardigan, Heus, &amp; Thomas, 2009) defines a catalog
code. A notable feature is a codebook which saves the exact wording of
all the questions. In addition, the ICPSR provides an index of all
variable names that are used in the data sets. DDI-Lifecycle is an
extension of DDI that describes the broader context in which the survey
was administered as well as the details about the preservation of the
file (see Section 5.3).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="repositories-of-governmental-and-ngo-statistical-agencies">
<h2>Repositories of Governmental and NGO Statistical Agencies<a class="headerlink" href="#repositories-of-governmental-and-ngo-statistical-agencies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Statistical data collection is a core function of government. Most
countries have national statistical agencies. While these statistical
collections often emphasize social data, they also include related
indicators such as agricultural and industrial output and housing, such
as Statistics New Zealand, and the Korean Social Science Data Archive
(KOSSDA). European data sets are maintained in the Consortium of
European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA)<a class="reference external" href="%5Bhttps://www.cessda.eu/%5D%7B.underline%7D">^13</a> and the European
Social Survey.<a class="reference external" href="https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/">^14</a> Australia has a broad data management initiative,
ANDS.[^15] Many U.S. governmental data sets are collected at
data.gov.[^16] In addition, there are many non-governmental and
inter-governmental agencies such as the OECD, the World Bank, and the
United Nations, which host data sets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-data-repositories">
<h2>Other Data Repositories<a class="headerlink" href="#other-data-repositories" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many data sets are produced, curated, and used in the natural sciences
such as astronomy and geosciences. Some of these data sets have highly
automated data collection, elaborate archives and established curation
methods. Many of these repositories include multiple data sets for which
access is supported with portals or data cubes (see Section 6.1). For
instance, massive amounts of geophysical data and related text documents
are collected in the EarthCube<a class="reference external" href="https://www.earthcube.org/">^17</a> portal. The Science.gov portal is
established by the U.S. Office of Science Technology and Policy. NASA
supports approximately 25 different data portals. Each satellite in the
Earth Observation System (EOS) may provide hundreds of streams of
data,<a class="reference external" href="https://pds.nasa.gov/">^18</a> with much common metadata. This provides a context analogous
to study-level metadata. Likewise, there are massive genomics and
proteomics data sets which are accessible via portals such as
UniProt<a class="reference external" href="https://www.uniprot.org/">^19</a> and the Protein Data Bank<a class="reference external" href="http://www.rcsb.org/">^20</a> along with suites of tools
for exploring them. Similarly, there are very large data sets from
medical research such as from clinical trials and from clinical practice
including Electronic Health Records (EHRs).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ecosystem-of-texts-and-data-sets">
<h2>Ecosystem of Texts and Data Sets<a class="headerlink" href="#ecosystem-of-texts-and-data-sets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Data sets are often associated with text reports. For example, the Dryad
Digital Repository<a class="reference external" href="https://datadryad.org/">^21</a> hosts data sets from scholarly publications
which require the deposit of data associated with scholarly papers
accepted for publication. In addition, data sets may be cited in much
the same way that research reports are cited. Formal citation
facilitates tracing the origins of data used in analyses and helps to
acknowledge the work of the creators of the data sets. Standards have
been developed for such citations (Martone, 2014; Silvello, 2017).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="services">
<h1>SERVICES<a class="headerlink" href="#services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The purpose of metadata and other aspects of information organization
and management is to provide services to users. Indeed, “service
science” is an approach in information technology which focuses on the
design and delivery of services rather than on underlying technologies.</p>
<div class="section" id="search">
<h2>Search<a class="headerlink" href="#search" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Searching for data sets differs from the familiar web-based text search
because data repositories are generally hosted by either relational
databases or semantic triplestores. Even where the data are stored on
separate servers the metadata can be harvested and searched. This type
of federated search is supported by the Open Archives Initiative
Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH);<a class="reference external" href="https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/">^22</a> both data.gov and ICPSR
use OAI-PMH.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="from-statistical-packages-to-virtual-research-environments">
<h2>From Statistical Packages to Virtual Research Environments<a class="headerlink" href="#from-statistical-packages-to-virtual-research-environments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There is an increasingly rich set of analytic tools. Some of the
earliest tools were statistical packages such as SPSS, R, SAS, and
STATA. These were gradually enhanced with data visualization and other
analytic software. The current generation of tools such as Jupyter,
RSpace, and eLab notebooks (ELN) integrate annotations, workflows, raw
data, and data analysis into one platform. In addition, some
repositories have developed their own powerful data exploration tools
such as ICPSR Colectica<a class="reference external" href="https://www.colectica.com/">^23</a> for DDI and the GSS Data Explorer<a class="reference external" href="https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/">^24</a>.
Virtual research environments (VREs) are typically organized by research
communities to coordinate data sets with search and analytic tools. For
instance, the Virtual Astronomy Observation (VAO) uses Jupyter to
provide users with a robust research environment. WissKI<a class="reference external" href="http://wiss-ki.eu">^25</a> is a
platform for coordinating digital humanities data sets which are based
on Drupal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preservation">
<h2>Preservation<a class="headerlink" href="#preservation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Lost data is often irreplaceable. Even if the data is not entirely lost,
users need confidence that the quality of stored data has not been
compromised. Moreover, although data storage prices are declining
dramatically, we cannot save everything and the cost of maintaining a
trusted repository remains substantial. Many of these challenges are
familiar from traditional archives. For instance, selection policies
typical in archives could help in controlling the many poorly documented
data sets in some repositories. Yet, prioritization is difficult<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/">^26</a>
(Whyte &amp; Wilson, 2010).</p>
<p>The Open Archival Information System (OAIS) provides a reference model
for the management of archives (Lee, 2010). The OAIS framework has been
incorporated into the ICPSR DDI-Lifecycle model. The Integrated
Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS)<a class="reference external" href="http://irods.org">^27</a> is a policy-based archival
management system developed for large data stores. It implements a
service-oriented architecture (SOA) to support best practices
established by archivists.</p>
<p>Provenance records the history of an entity. This can help to ensure
confidence in its authenticity. For data in a repository, provenance
often means tracing the history of repository operations. The history of
transitions is often recorded as event data, where the events are what
happened to the data in the dataset. Typically, provenance ontologies
include actors, events, and digital objects. Potentially, blockchains
could provide an even greater level of trust in digital provenance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="metadata-quality-and-metadata-management">
<h2>Metadata Quality and Metadata Management<a class="headerlink" href="#metadata-quality-and-metadata-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Metadata, whether for texts or data sets, needs to be complete,
consistent, standardized, machine processable, and timely (Park, 2009).
A metadata editor supports the assignment of quality metadata (e.g.,
Gonclaves, O’Conner, et al., 2019). When collections or metadata
standards change, the repository librarian must revise metadata (Tonkin,
2009). This might be particularly needed when updating metadata from
data streams<a class="reference external" href="http://schema.org/dataset/datastreams">^28</a> such as those from satellite downlinks or smart-city
sensors.</p>
<p>Although survey results are generally aggregated across individuals,
individual-level data is sometimes very useful. Some repositories of
survey data include micro-data, data for the responses that individuals
gave to survey questions.[^29] Currently, there are no distinct metadata
tags for such data; they are embedded into repository data. Moreover,
the individual level of analysis raises privacy concerns and needs to be
carefully managed; at the least, access should be limited to qualified
researchers.</p>
<p>Metadata registries, such as the Marine Metadata Interoperability
Ontology Registry and Repository,<a class="reference external" href="https://mmisw.org/">^30</a> record usage. The Registry of
Research Data Repositories (re3data registry),<a class="reference external" href="https://www.re3data.org/">^31</a> which is operated by
DataCite, links to more than 2000 different repositories each of which
holds many data sets. Each of the repositories is described by the
re3data.org schema for the description of research data repositories
(Rücknagel, Vierkant, et al., 2015).</p>
<p>Metadata application profiles provide constraints on the types of
entities that can be included in the metadata for a given application.
For instance, DCAT Application Profiles (DCAT-AP) support standardized
metadata exchange between repositories in different jurisdictions in the
EU.<a class="reference external" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/release/dcat-ap/11">^32</a></p>

<div class="section" id="data-cubes">
<h2>Data Cubes<a class="headerlink" href="#data-cubes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many notable data management techniques were originally developed for
managing and processing business data.[^33] One such technique is data
cubes, which support access to multidimensional data. They present data
as if it filled cells of a high-dimensional cube, even if the data will
probably not fill all of the cells. Users can generate different views
of the data by drilling-down, rolling-up, and slicing-and-dicing across
cells. For complex data sets, there will be many dimensions. To
facilitate retrieval, there can be a rich pre-coordinated index for
common queries; other queries can be implemented with slower methods
such as hashing or B-trees.</p>
<p>Data cubes have been extended beyond business information processing to
cubes such as the Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (<em>SDMX) used in
the financial services industry and the</em> W3C Data Cube<a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">^34</a> standard
that is applied in projects such as EarthCube.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sequential-activities-and-modeling-research">
<h2>Sequential Activities and Modeling Research<a class="headerlink" href="#sequential-activities-and-modeling-research" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Entities change over time, yet knowledge representation frameworks
rarely model change. In order to represent changes, models need to
represent transitions, processes, and other sequential activities. Such
modeling is closer to the Unified Modeling Language (UML) or even
programming languages than to ontologies. In fact, modeling change is
routine for state machines, Petri nets, and other transition models. A
“model-layer” that allows general statements to be made about sequential
activities could incorporate both ontology and transitionals (Allen &amp;
Kim, 2018).</p>
<p>Models of sequential activities include workflows and mechanisms (e.g.,
Allen, 2018). A workflow is a structure for managing a sequence of
activities and is a natural fit for describing research methods and
analyses (Austin, Bloom, et al., 2017). The Taverna workflow tool has
been widely used in the MyExperiment<a class="reference external" href="https://www.myexperiment.org/home">^35</a> project, which provides a
framework for capturing and posting research methods and incorporates
ontologies such as FOAF.</p>
<p>Allen (2015, 2018) has proposed direct representation of entire research
reports. This approach uses a programming language that blends upper
ontologies with object-oriented programming to do semantic modeling.
Beyond modeling events, it is also possible to use structured
argumentation and assertions in scientific research reports.
Potentially, social mechanisms (e.g., Hedstrom &amp; Ylikoski, 2010) and
community models could be implemented. Further, highly-structured
evidence and claims might be applied to the evaluation of evidence-based
social policy.</p>

<h2>Information Institutions and Organizations<a class="headerlink" href="#information-institutions-and-organizations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Libraries and archives (whether traditional or digital) have the
mission, and often the resources, to develop standards and maintain
information over the long-term. As noted earlier (Section 5.3),
preservation is the fundamental concern for archival collections.
Information institutions often have formal collection management
strategies, metrics, and policies. These include Web and repository
metrics and analytics, usage statistics such as reports of how many
downloads were made from data sets, and procedures for updates and
formatting standards.</p>
<p>In addition to traditional information institutions, there are now many
other players. These new players have slightly different mandates. For
example, Schema.org’s primary mission is to provide a structure that
improves indexing by search engine companies. Nonetheless, these
organizations often adopt best practices similar to those of traditional
information organizations.</p>
<p>CrossRef<a class="reference external" href="https://www.crossref.org/">^36</a> and DataCite are DOI registration agencies. CrossRef is a
portal to metadata for scholarly articles, while DataCite provides
metadata for digital objects associated with research. Increasingly, the
two projects are coordinating. ORCID iDs<a class="reference external" href="https://orcid.org/">^37</a> are persistent digital
identifiers assigned to authors. The emergence of structured identifiers
such as DOIs and ORCID iDs has allowed the development of services such
as VIVO<a class="reference external" href="https://duraspace.org/vivo/">^38</a> and the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)<a class="reference external" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph/">^39</a> which allow

<p>We are now well into the era of cloud computing (Foster &amp; Gannon, 2017),
allowing flexible allocation of computing, networking and storage
resources, which facilitates Software as a Service (SaaS). The
compatibility of the versions of software packages needed for data
management is often a challenge. Containers, such as those from Docker,
allow compatible versions of software to be assembled and run on a
virtual computer. A container could hold datasets, workflows, and the
programs used to analyze the data, making the analyses readily
replicable. Highly-networked data centers also facilitate the Internet
of Things (IoT) which will generate massive data sets such as for “smart

<p>Data may not be useful when stand-alone without context. Some of the
biggest issues for the retrieval of information from data sets concern
information organization, which help provide context. Metadata supports
the discovery of and access to data sets. We need richer, more

The FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and
stewardship, <em>Scientific Data, 3</em>, 160018. doi: 10.1038/sdata.2016.18</p>
<p>[^1]: The FAIR Guidelines have been extended from scholarly texts to
data sets (Wilkinson,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618#auth-2">Dumontier</a>, et
al., 2018).</p>
<p>[^4]: Such operators need to be unambiguous. For example, Digital Object
Identifiers (DOIs, <a class="reference external" href="http://doi.org">http://doi.org</a>) were developed for scholarly
journals and are assigned by publishers, with a part of the DOI code
being a unique publisher ID. While the DOIs may identify more than
one data set, version numbers distinguish the data sets. For
instance, the entire GSS (General Social Survey) has only one DOI,
but it is possible to drill down through the different data sets by
specifying version numbers.</p>
<p>[^5]: Schema.org is a project of a consortium of search-engine
companies. The Schema.org dataset schema
(<a class="reference external" href="https://schema.org/Dataset">https://schema.org/Dataset</a>) is used by the Google Data Search.</p>

Initiative (DDI) is different from the Data Discovery Index (DDI)
associated with DataMed.</p>

<p>[^29]: The term micro-data is used in two distinct ways. In the context
of HTML, it is associated with embedding Schema.org codes into web
pages similar to micro-formats. In the context of survey data, it
refers to individual-level data.</p>
